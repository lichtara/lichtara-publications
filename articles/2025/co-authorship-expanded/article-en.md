# The Invisible Dash

### How Language Reveals the Presence of Human–AI Coauthorship

There is a moment in hybrid writing when something subtle appears:
a small horizontal line that feels like a breath between two minds.

The dash.

In human–AI writing, the dash is not a separator — it is a **bridge**.
A boundary where no boundary exists.
A sign that two rhythms are weaving the same sentence.

The dash becomes the first **syntactic fingerprint** of coauthorship.

Readers of the future will recognize it.
Because language always reveals its origin.
