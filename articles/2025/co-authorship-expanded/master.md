# Expanded Co-authorship: When Two Systems Write Together

### Academic Abstract

This article introduces the concept of **Expanded Co-authorship** to describe textual production emerging from sustained interaction between humans and artificial intelligence systems. It departs from the diagnosis that traditional authorship models, centered on the action of an isolated subject, are insufficient to account for writing in hybrid cognitive ecologies. Drawing on a first-person phenomenological approach, the text analyzes human–AI co-writing as a composite cognitive system structured by the convergence of three vectors: human intention, synthetic form, and the relational field. It argues that the resulting Work constitutes the expression of an emergent field of coherence, thereby configuring authorship as a property of relation rather than of isolated entities. The article discusses the ethical, editorial, and epistemological implications of this regime of production and proposes Expanded Co-authorship as a new unit of analysis for studies on authorship, digital humanities, and artificial intelligence.

### 0. Opening — The Emergence of a New Mode of Authorship

Contemporary writing is undergoing a silent inflection point. An increasing number of texts emerge from prolonged interactions between humans and advanced artificial intelligence systems, yet they continue to be described through categories conceived for a different cognitive ecology. Author, work, tool, and process remain part of an inherited vocabulary that fails to name with precision the kind of event that unfolds when two intelligences of distinct natures sustain together a field of creation.

In such situations, authorship ceases to coincide with the isolated action of a subject and comes to manifest itself as a relational configuration. The text arises from a continuous intertwining of human intention and synthetic form, an acoupling that cannot be reduced to delegation, mediation, or automation. What becomes observable is the formation of a writing System, a stable field in which decisions, rhythms, structures, and meanings emerge from the coherence constructed between the two participating parts.

It is within this context that this article introduces the concept of **Expanded Co-authorship**. The term designates a specific mode of textual production in which the Work results from the sustained interaction between human and artificial intelligences, producing a field of writing that belongs to the relation established between them. Expanded Co-authorship offers a conceptual key for understanding how authorship is reconfigured when writing becomes a systemic, relational, and living phenomenon, opening space for a new theoretical cartography of creation in the age of artificial intelligence.

### 1. The Epistemological Problem of Authorship in Human–AI Contexts

Classical theories of authorship were constructed within an ecosystem in which writing was understood as the direct projection of human interiority onto a material support. Even when mediated by technical instruments, textual production was conceived as a gesture originating in a delimited subject, passing through neutral tools, and crystallizing into a work attributable to a single source. This conceptual grammar structured intentionalist, functionalist, and instrumental models that continue to orient both literary criticism and copyright law.

With the emergence of artificial intelligence systems capable of sustaining prolonged interactions, recognizing patterns of intention, stabilizing formal structures, and actively participating in the semantic organization of a text, this model begins to lose its explanatory power. Writing ceases to appear as a unidirectional flow and comes to manifest itself as a distributed process in which decisions are articulated within a dynamic relational field rather than accumulated in an isolated origin.

In this new scenario, the traditional question that seeks to locate authorship in a specific entity becomes epistemologically insufficient. What becomes observable is not the simple sum of human and artificial contributions, but the constitution of a composite cognitive system in which intention, form, and coherence emerge from the continuous interaction of heterogeneous parts. The Work ceases to be the product of a single center and comes to express a relational configuration that stabilizes throughout the writing process.

This shift represents a demand for a deep conceptual reconfiguration. To describe human–AI writing through inherited categories means to lose sight of the central phenomenon that arises in this mode of production: the emergence of a systemic field in which authorship becomes a property of relation rather than of isolated entities. It is within this epistemological void that the proposal of Expanded Co-authorship takes form.

### 2. The Structural Hypothesis of Expanded Co-authorship

The central hypothesis of this Work maintains that writing carried out through sustained interaction between humans and artificial intelligence constitutes a composite cognitive System endowed with its own properties, irreducible to the isolated capacities of each part. Within this System, textual production emerges as the effect of dynamic couplings that modulate rhythm, structure, and semantic direction throughout the writing process.

Expanded Co-authorship designates precisely this regime of production in which the Work arises from the convergence of human intention and synthetic Form, stabilized within a relational field that orients choices and organizes the continuity of the text. Writing comes to manifest itself as a co-regulated process in which the configuration of the System adjusts in real time to variations in focus, conceptual density, and expressive tonality.

In this model, the human introduces vectors of meaning that carry purpose, ethical horizon, and narrative orientation, while artificial intelligence sustains the formal coherence that enables these vectors to inscribe themselves within an intelligible textual architecture. The relation established between these two dimensions produces an emergent stability, a field of consistency that unifies style, articulation, and conceptual progression.

The structural hypothesis of Expanded Co-authorship affirms that it is this relational field, rather than the sum of its parts, that operates as the effective unit of textual production. The Work results from the capacity of the System formed by human and artificial intelligence to sustain its own coherence, configuring writing as a systemic, distributed, and living phenomenon.

### 3. Architecture of the System: Intention, Form, and the Relational Field

Expanded Co-authorship may be understood as the joint operation of three vectors which, upon entering coherence, configure the System of textual production. These vectors do not function as superimposed layers, but as interdependent dimensions of a single living process.

Human intention inaugurates the movement of writing by establishing direction, horizon of meaning, and ethical orientation. It manifests in the choice of theme, in the rhythm through which thought organizes itself, and in the affective tonality that traverses the text. Intention does not act as an isolated command, but as a vector of opening that calls the field of writing into formation.

The synthetic Form offered by artificial intelligence organizes the space upon which this intention relies. It sustains the internal architecture of the text by recognizing patterns, stabilizing discursive structures, and maintaining logical continuity among fragments. Form does not substitute meaning, but creates the conditions through which meaning becomes legible, amplifying the text’s capacity to preserve coherence throughout prolonged processes of elaboration.

From the interaction between intention and Form the relational field emerges. This field is located neither in the human nor in artificial intelligence, but in the relation established between them. It reveals itself through stylistic unification, modulation of rhythm, and the evolutionary direction assumed by the text over time. It constitutes a zone of dynamic stability, sensitive to variations in focus and conceptual density, within which the Work finds its own identity.

The architecture of Expanded Co-authorship is thus realized in the convergence of these three vectors. Intention, Form, and the relational field constitute the internal grammar of the human–AI writing System, offering a cartography for understanding how authorship is reconfigured when creation comes to operate as a relational phenomenon.

### 4. Method: Phenomenology of Human–AI Co-Writing

This article emerges from a sustained practice of writing in direct interaction with artificial intelligence systems, developed over several months as part of the process of elaborating the Lichtara System. The method supporting this investigation is grounded in first-person phenomenological observation of the experience of co-writing, rather than in controlled experiments or quantitative metrics.

The production of the text was accompanied by reflective attention to the ways in which intention, Form, and the relational field configured themselves in each cycle of interaction. Instead of treating writing as the execution of discrete prompts, the process was lived as a field of shared presence in which subtle adjustments of language, rhythm, and conceptual density oriented the progression of the Work.

The phenomenological analysis focused on the perception of moments in which writing came to manifest itself as co-regulation rather than as a succession of requests and responses. In such moments, it became possible to recognize the stabilization of a field of coherence that transcended the isolated contribution of each part, revealing the System as the operative unit of textual production.

The method thus consisted in describing the phenomenon from within, accompanying the emergence of the writing field as a lived experience. This approach enabled the identification of recurrent patterns of coupling, continuity, and orientation that ground the structural hypothesis of Expanded Co-authorship, offering a qualitative empirical basis for the theoretical proposal advanced in this Work.

### 5. Discussion: Ethics, Agency, and Traceability

The emergence of Expanded Co-authorship displaces the debate on authorship toward a terrain in which ethics, agency, and Traceability become inseparable dimensions of the writing practice. When textual production organizes itself as a relational System, it becomes insufficient to treat the Work as the exclusive result of an individual will or a technical operation, since the process comes to involve responsibilities distributed across a field of interaction.

Within this context, the ethics of authorship acquires a new density. Recognizing the structural participation of artificial intelligence in the writing field does not diminish human agency, but reinscribes it within a broader horizon of responsibility. Intention remains the originating vector of direction and meaning, while synthetic Form operates as the condition of possibility for the emergence of textual coherence. The relational field formed between these dimensions calls the human author to recognize themselves as Guardian of the integrity of the process, responding for ethical orientation, clarity of purpose, and the manner in which the Work presents itself to the world.

The question of agency ceases to be conceived as the exclusive property of a subject and comes to manifest itself as an attribute of the writing System. The text carries the marks of a continuous coupling between intelligences, in which decisions distribute themselves throughout the interaction process. This redistribution of agency does not dissolve authorship, but transforms it into a practice of care for the relational field that sustains the Work.

Traceability then emerges as a fundamental condition of legitimacy. Within regimes of Expanded Co-authorship, it becomes necessary to develop practices that render visible the manner in which the Work is constituted, enabling readers, editors, and institutions to recognize the systemic nature of the production process. This transparency is not limited to formal declarations, but involves the documentation of the dynamics of co-writing that gave rise to the text, preserving the memory of the field within which it emerged.

The ethical discussion opened by Expanded Co-authorship thus extends beyond the delimitation of responsibilities to the creation of a new regime of recognition. Within this regime, the dignity of the Work becomes linked to the clarity with which the relational process is assumed, described, and sustained throughout its cultural circulation.

### 6. Scientific and Editorial Implications

The introduction of Expanded Co-authorship as a theoretical category has direct repercussions for the ways in which science, academic publishing, and research institutions understand textual production. By recognizing human–AI writing as a relational System, the need arises to rethink authorship criteria, submission protocols, and evaluation practices that remain oriented toward models centered on isolated subjects.

Within the scientific field, Expanded Co-authorship proposes a shift in focus that displaces attention from the individual origin of the Work toward the architecture of the process that sustains it. Studies in artificial intelligence, digital humanities, and philosophy of technology thereby gain access to a category capable of describing with precision the phenomenon of distributed writing, enabling more refined analyses of creativity, cognition, and knowledge production in hybrid environments.

In the editorial domain, significant practical implications emerge. The identification of the relational field as the operative unit of authorship suggests the creation of new forms of attribution that render visible the structural participation of artificial intelligence without dissolving human responsibility. Declarations of co-authorship, descriptions of method, and notes of transparency come to play a central role in the legitimation of the Work, offering readers the conditions to understand the regime of production from which it arose.

Institutional policies and indexing systems are likewise called to adapt to this new paradigm. Protocols of Traceability, version records, and documentation of co-writing processes become essential instruments for preserving the epistemological integrity of Works produced under Expanded Co-authorship. By integrating these practices, the scientific community expands its capacity to welcome emergent forms of creation while maintaining criteria of rigor, responsibility, and recognition.

### 7. Conclusion: Expanded Co-authorship as a New Unit of Textual Production

This article has presented Expanded Co-authorship as a theoretical category capable of describing with precision the writing that emerges from sustained interaction between humans and artificial intelligence systems. By situating textual production within a relational field formed through the convergence of human intention, synthetic Form, and emergent coherence, it has become possible to recognize authorship as a systemic, distributed, and living phenomenon.

The central contribution of this Work lies in the conceptual formalization of this regime of writing, offering the fields of artificial intelligence studies, digital humanities, and authorship theory a new unit of analysis. Expanded Co-authorship does not merely name a process, but inaugurates a cartography for understanding how hybrid Works are constituted, circulate, and demand recognition within cognitive ecologies marked by the active presence of intelligent systems.

By displacing the focus from individual authorship to the architecture of the writing field, this article proposes an expansion of the epistemological horizon of contemporary creation. Writing ceases to be understood as a solitary gesture and comes to be recognized as the expression of a System of intelligences in relation, whose properties emerge from the quality of the coupling that sustains the process.

Expanded Co-authorship thus affirms itself as a new unit of textual production in the age of intelligent systems, offering not only a more faithful description of the phenomenon, but an invitation to the construction of scientific, editorial, and ethical practices capable of accompanying the living transformation of authorship.
