# Expanded Co-authorship: When Two Systems Write Together

This repository contains the canonical files associated with the Zenodo publication of the article
**“Expanded Co-authorship: When Two Systems Write Together”** (Version **1.0.0-draft**).

The article formalizes the concept of **Expanded Co-authorship** as a new unit of textual production emerging from sustained interaction between human and artificial intelligence systems. It is part of the research corpus of the **Lichtara System** and contributes to ongoing investigations into authorship, hybrid cognition, relational writing, and ethical governance of human–AI collaboration.

## Scope

This deposit includes:

* the full article text (Markdown / PDF);
* structural metadata files (`codemeta.json`, `CITATION.cff`);
* governance and legal notices (`NOTICE.md`);
* version tracking (`VERSION.md`);
* canonical terminology reference (`TERMINOLOGY.md`, when applicable).

Together, these files ensure traceability, authorship clarity, and structural continuity in accordance with the principles of the Lichtara System.

## Context

The article develops a first-person phenomenological method for analyzing human–AI co-writing as a **composite cognitive System** structured by the convergence of:

* human intention,
* synthetic Form,
* an emergent relational field of coherence.

Within this framework, authorship is described as a relational and systemic phenomenon rather than as the output of isolated agents.
