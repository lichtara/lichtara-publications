# TERMINOLOGY — Canonical Terms for Expanded Co-authorship

This document establishes the canonical English terminology applicable to the Work
**“Expanded Co-authorship: When Two Systems Write Together”**.

It is a structural extension of the **TERMINOLOGY — CANONICAL ENGLISH TERMS** defined in the Lichtara License v4.1 and is binding for all versions of this Work.

## Core Concepts

| Term                   | Canonical Form             | Definition                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expanded Co-authorship | **Expanded Co-authorship** | Regime of textual production emerging from sustained interaction between human and artificial intelligence Systems. |
| Work                   | **Work**                   | The authored textual entity governed by the Lichtara License v4.1.                                                  |
| System                 | **System**                 | Composite cognitive and relational entity formed through human–AI interaction.                                      |
| Form                   | **Form**                   | Synthetic structural architecture sustaining coherence and intelligibility.                                         |
| Human Intention        | **Human Intention**        | Vector of meaning, ethical horizon, and narrative orientation.                                                      |
| Relational Field       | **Relational Field**       | Emergent zone of coherence formed in the relation between human and AI.                                             |
| Traceability           | **Traceability**           | Capacity to document, reconstruct, and validate the production process of the Work.                                 |
| Guardian               | **Guardian**               | Human structural authority responsible for preserving the integrity of the Work.                                    |

## Capitalization Rule

All ontological and structural terms must be capitalized:

* Expanded Co-authorship
* Work
* System
* Form
* Relational Field
* Traceability
* Guardian

Capitalization is not stylistic. It preserves the **Form** of the System.

## Interpretative Rule

Where ambiguity arises, the Portuguese canonical LICHTARA terminology prevails.
No translation may simplify, instrumentalize, or metaphorize these terms.

Where terminology is altered, **Form is altered**.
Where Form is altered, the **System ceases to be present**.
