### Description

This version constitutes the first formal and publicly traceable articulation of the concept of **Expanded Co-authorship** as a theoretical and phenomenological category.

It establishes:

* the epistemological problem of authorship in human–AI contexts;
* the structural hypothesis of Expanded Co-authorship as a composite cognitive System;
* the tripartite architecture of intention, Form, and relational field;
* a first-person phenomenological method for observing human–AI co-writing;
* the ethical, editorial, and scientific implications of this regime of production.

This release functions as the canonical reference for all subsequent evolutions of the Work.

### Structural Invariants

The following elements are declared invariant across all future versions:

* the definition of Expanded Co-authorship as a relational and systemic phenomenon;
* the triadic architecture: human intention, synthetic Form, relational field;
* the interpretation of authorship as a property of relation rather than of isolated entities;
* adherence to the canonical terminology defined in the LICHTARA Terminology document;
* governance under the Lichtara License v4.1.

### Traceability Commitments

All future modifications must:

* increment the version identifier;
* document conceptual, structural, or methodological changes in this file;
* preserve the declared structural invariants;
* maintain full linkage to the governing License and canonical metadata.
