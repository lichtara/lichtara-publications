## Premise
Velocity is a decision. The dash is invisible because it is negotiated in breath, stance, and attention before any visible stride.

## Hook
On a race replay, the champion wins in the frames before the start. Shoulders drop, eyes lock, and hesitation leaves. The run only confirms a choice already made.

## Argument
- We experience speed through compressed decision time, not only shorter execution.
- Pauses are active, storing tension and direction for the next move.
- To design for speed, design the entry ramp: reduce doubt and shorten the script before action.

## What to watch
- Micro posture before go-time: jaw, inhale-exhale rhythm, where pressure lands on the feet.
- Environmental cues: lighting, copy, friction that either signals safety or causes delay.
- Language: verbs that imply waiting vs. verbs that invite an immediate leap.

## Practices
1. **Preload sequences**: script tiny rituals before action (two breaths, one cue) and measure reaction time.
2. **Trim affordances**: remove one friction from the starting path (one less tap, one less confirmation, one less context switch).
3. **Slow-motion review**: record or log the first 500 ms; annotate what changed the decision to accelerate.

## Closing thought
Speed is chosen in intent. Make space for that invisible dash and it will show up in every visible step.
