## Premise
Speed is less about distance crossed and more about the micro-choices that compress time. The dash is invisible because the body already decided before anyone saw movement.

## Hook
A runner finishes a 100 m dash. Replay in slow motion shows that the winning margin happened in the frames before the gun: breath held, posture tuned, doubt muted.

## Argument
- The perception of velocity is constructed by expectations and gaps.
- Pauses are active; they load the next action with tension and direction.
- Designing for speed means choreographing decision time, not only execution time.

## Signals to observe
- Micro-posture before action: jaw, breath, foot pressure.
- Environmental cues that either invite or block acceleration.
- Language patterns: verbs in future tense vs. present imperative.

## Practices
1. **Preload windows**: define small rituals before action (two breaths, one cue) and measure their effect on response time.
2. **Shorten affordances**: remove one friction point from the starting sequence (button, confirmation, context-switch).
3. **Replay in slow motion**: film or log the pre-action window; annotate what changed the first 500 ms.

## Closing thought
The dash that matters is the one that happens in intent. What we make should honor that invisible zone where speed is chosen.
