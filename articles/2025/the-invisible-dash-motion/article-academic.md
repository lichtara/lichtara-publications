## Abstract
This note frames perceived speed as a function of decision latency rather than execution time. Observations from sprint starts and product interactions suggest that micro-pauses before action load intent and thus determine downstream velocity.

## Introduction
Literature on reaction time highlights the impact of anticipation, priming, and affordances. In applied settings - athletics and interface design alike - the window between stimulus and overt motion remains under-specified.

## Proposition
1. **Decision latency (DL)** is the elapsed time between stimulus recognition and irreversible commitment to action.
2. **Perceived velocity (PV)** correlates inversely with DL even when execution time (ET) remains constant: PV = f(1 / DL) given stable ET.
3. Environmental and linguistic cues can systematically lower DL without compromising accuracy.

## Observational notes
- Sprint footage shows winning margins established prior to visible motion; markers include breath hold and plantar pressure shifts.
- In digital products, users report "fast" flows when pre-action scripts are simplified (fewer confirmations, clearer intent markers), even when network latency is unchanged.

## Implications
- Training should allocate deliberate practice to the pre-action window (200-500 ms).
- Interface design should prioritize intent clarity and friction removal before execution steps.
- Measurement protocols need high-resolution logging around DL to reveal effects hidden in aggregate ET.
