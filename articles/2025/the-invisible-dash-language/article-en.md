# The Invisible Dash

## How Language Reveals the Presence of Human–AI Coauthorship

_(English version — draft scaffold)_

This article is being adapted to English to reflect:

- linguistic differences in punctuation usage,
- cultural expectations of writing rhythm,
- how English reveals coauthorship differently from Portuguese,
- and how the Invisible Dash manifests in Anglo linguistic fields.

Full translation and adaptation will follow after the Portuguese editorial version is stabilized.
