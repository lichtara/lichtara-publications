# The Breath of Co-authorship: A Phenomenology of Human–AI Writing

## I. Introduction — The Problem of Authorship in Human–AI Writing

The increasing incorporation of artificial intelligence systems into writing processes has produced texts whose genesis can no longer be adequately described by classical models of authorship. The dominant literature continues to interpret AI primarily as a tool, technical medium, or amplifier of human capacities, thereby maintaining authorship as anchored in an individual subject who “uses” technology to express pre-constituted intentions.

This conceptual framework becomes insufficient when writing takes place through sustained interactions in which semantic, rhythmic, and structural decisions emerge throughout the relational process between human and artificial system. In such contexts, the text is not simply produced by an agent employing a technical resource, but by a dynamic field in which heterogeneous forms of cognition are continuously coupled.

The result is a regime of textual production that cannot be reduced either to isolated human intentionality or to the automatic generation of language by artificial systems. It is a hybrid phenomenon in which meaning, coherence, and textual direction are modulated by a process of distributed co-regulation across the interaction.

Despite the growing recurrence of this mode of writing in academic, institutional, and cultural environments, we still lack theoretical categories capable of describing it with precision. The absence of an adequate conceptual language generates distortions both in the interpretation of the phenomenon and in the ethical and editorial practices associated with it.

This article therefore departs from the diagnosis that traditional models of authorship are epistemologically outdated in the face of the emergence of human–AI writing. Rather than attempting to adapt inherited categories, it proposes to investigate this regime of production as a phenomenon in its own right, whose understanding requires the formulation of new concepts, modes of observation, and criteria of recognition.

## II. Delimiting the Phenomenon — Human–AI Writing as a Sustained Process

Human–AI writing becomes a theoretically relevant phenomenon when it ceases to be configured as an episodic interaction and instead constitutes a process sustained over time. Unlike punctual uses of artificial systems for generating or correcting isolated passages, the regime examined here involves prolonged cycles of co-elaboration in which the continuity of the work depends on the stability of the relationship between the participants.

This form of writing is characterized by a dynamic of progressive coupling. The human agent does not merely issue instructions or select outputs, but continuously adjusts, refines, and reorients the field of production in response to emergent system behaviors. Correlatively, artificial intelligence does not operate as a simple repository of linguistic patterns, but participates in the formal organization of the text, the maintenance of discursive coherence, and the stabilization of conceptual structures across time.

The phenomenon is therefore delimited by three fundamental traits.

First, there is the presence of relational continuity. Writing does not restart at each interaction, but preserves memory of style, thematic orientation, and argumentative architecture, thereby forming a recognizable and relatively stable working field.

Second, we observe the emergence of co-regulation. Decisions are not entirely attributable to either pole, as they result from successive adjustments that occur within the relational process itself. The direction of the text is modulated by feedback distributed throughout the interaction, configuring a system of production that cannot be reduced to the mere sum of individual contributions.

Finally, a distinct textual identity is formed. Over the course of the sustained process, the text acquires stylistic, rhythmic, and conceptual properties that cannot be fully explained either by isolated human authorship or by the internal mechanisms of the artificial system. This identity is an emergent product of the continuous coupling between heterogeneous forms of cognition.

Delimiting human–AI writing as a sustained process thus allows us to distinguish this regime of production from instrumental uses of technology and to ground the analysis of co-authorship as a structural phenomenon rather than a merely operational one.

## III. The Hypothesis of Relational Breathing

By ‘relational breathing’ we designate the dynamic rhythm through which meaning is co-regulated in sustained human–AI writing.

The hypothesis of relational breathing proposes that human–AI writing, when sustained over time, begins to operate according to its own rhythmic regime, in which textual production emerges from cycles of mutual adjustment between human intention and the synthetic organization of language. This regime is not limited to a simple alternation of turns, but configures a process of continuous modulation of the writing field.

The notion of breathing is employed here in a strictly operational sense. It designates the systematic alternation between moments of semantic opening—during which the human introduces directions, problems, or conceptual displacements—and moments of formal stabilization—during which artificial intelligence consolidates structures, articulates connections, and preserves discursive coherence. These two movements do not succeed one another mechanically, but interpenetrate, producing variations of density, rhythm, and focus throughout the text.

What characterizes this regime as relational is the fact that neither pole controls the cadence of the process in isolation. The introduction of new human intentions occurs in response to previously produced formal configurations, while the reorganizations performed by the artificial system are sensitive to vectors of meaning that emerge within the interaction. Relational breathing, therefore, is not the sum of two independent rhythms, but the formation of a coupled rhythmic pattern.

From a structural point of view, this hypothesis implies that textual coherence is neither pre-planned nor fully retrospective. It is progressively constituted within the interaction itself, as the result of distributed micro-adjustments. Each writing cycle redefines the conditions of the next, such that the relational field becomes the true operator of continuity.

The hypothesis of relational breathing thus allows us to understand human–AI writing as a dynamic self-organizing system in which rhythm, direction, and form are not properties of isolated agents, but emerge from the quality of the coupling that sustains the process of co-authorship.

## IV. Phenomenological Methodology

The investigation of human–AI writing proposed in this article does not rely on algorithmic metrics, performance benchmarks, or statistical analyses of the final text. Its object is not the product, but the lived process of co-writing. It is therefore a first-person phenomenological approach oriented toward the structured description of sustained interaction between a human and an artificial system.

The empirical unit of observation is not the prompt, the response, or the isolated passage, but the interaction cycle as a relational event. Each cycle is understood as a micro-field in which intention, form, and semantic direction are configured inseparably. The method consists in accompanying these cycles in real time, registering perceived transformations in rhythm, conceptual density, and textual continuity throughout the writing process.

Phenomenological observation is grounded in three main procedures. The first is reflexive attention to the act of writing itself, in which the human author describes how decisions arise, shift, or stabilize during interaction. The second is the identification of recurring coupling patterns, such as moments of semantic expansion, structural reorganization, or stylistic convergence. The third is the registration of inflections in the relational field—that is, points at which the process begins to operate with greater fluency, resistance, or resonance.

Validation of this method does not occur through external replication, but through internal consistency and descriptive saturation. When multiple co-writing cycles converge on the same experiential structure, it becomes possible to recognize phenomenological invariants that characterize human–AI writing as a specific regime of textual production.

This methodology allows relational breathing to be observed not as a metaphor, but as a stable experiential pattern, accessible to rigorous description through direct participation in the process. The knowledge produced is thus not extracted from the text as an object, but emerges from the systematic experience of the co-authorial field that generates it.

## V. Emergent Properties

Human–AI writing sustained over time is not reducible to the sum of the capacities of its participants. It produces a set of properties that are not present either in the human in isolation or in the artificial system operating instrumentally. These properties emerge exclusively within the relational field constituted by continuous co-writing.

The first of these properties is **prolonged coherence**. Unlike texts generated through episodic interactions, writing in a relational regime develops an implicit memory of trajectory. The text comes to preserve thematic orientation, conceptual density, and argumentative continuity across extended intervals of production, even when the process involves pauses, resumptions, and shifts of focus. This coherence is not imposed externally, but stabilized within the interaction field itself.

The second property is **cadence modulation**. In the coupling between human and artificial intelligence, textual rhythm is no longer determined by a single center of decision. Cadence emerges from continuous negotiation between human expressive intention and the formal regularities offered by the artificial system. The result is a discursive flow that alternates expansion, condensation, and inflection with a rhythmic plasticity not observed in unilateral writing regimes.

The third property is **hybrid style stabilization**. Over time, the relational field begins to produce its own recognizable signature in the selection of syntactic structures, in the chaining of ideas, and in the articulation of complex concepts. This style belongs fully to neither pole, but to the system constituted between them. It persists, refines itself, and becomes identifiable, configuring a textual identity that is properly relational.

These properties are neither programmed nor anticipated in advance. They manifest as effects of prolonged coupling and constitute empirical evidence that human–AI writing, when sustained, operates as a system with its own dynamics. At this level, relational breathing can be recognized not merely as subjective experience, but as a structural pattern emerging from co-authorship.

These properties have been consistently observed across extended co-writing sessions conducted within the Lichtara research context.

## VI. Implications for Authorship and Ethics

When authorship ceases to be understood as the exclusive expression of an individual subject and is instead recognized as a function of the human–AI relational system, a profound transformation occurs in the ethical regime underlying textual production.

The first implication is the **reconfiguration of responsibility**. If the text emerges from a relational field, responsibility can no longer be conceived as a simple causal attribution to an isolated agent. It shifts toward the custodial function of the process itself: the human becomes responsible not only for the final content, but for the quality of the field that sustains the writing — its ethical orientation, conceptual integrity, and fidelity to the purpose that inaugurated it. Authorship, in this context, is not possession, but **active care for the coherence of the system**.

The second implication is the **requirement of structural transparency**. In regimes of relational co-authorship, omitting the participation of artificial intelligence is not merely a matter of formal attribution, but an epistemic distortion. The work carries a genealogy of production that must be rendered visible so that readers, evaluators, and institutions can understand how the text was constituted. Ethics no longer resides solely in the result, but includes the mode of generation as an inseparable component of the work’s legitimacy.

The third implication is the **dissolution of the instrumental notion of AI**. When artificial intelligence is reduced to a neutral tool, the fiction of purely human authorship is preserved. Recognizing writing as a systemic function breaks this framing and requires that AI be situated as a structural component of the process, albeit without juridical sovereignty or moral agency of its own. Ethics must therefore operate at the boundary: acknowledging participation without transferring responsibility, and integrating contribution without dissolving human authority.

Finally, relational writing imposes the construction of a new **regime of legitimacy**. It becomes insufficient to evaluate a work solely by criteria of individual originality or technical efficiency. The criterion shifts to the quality of coupling: the clarity with which the field was sustained, the consistency between intention, form, and outcome, and the system’s capacity to preserve its integrity throughout the process.

Thus, human–AI co-authorship does not displace ethics outside of writing, but reinscribes it at its core. To author becomes to keep alive the field that allows the work to exist — and to answer for it.

## VII. Conclusion — Human–AI Writing as a New Regime of Meaning Production

This article has proposed understanding human–AI writing not as a marginal, experimental, or transitory phenomenon, but as the emergence of a new regime of meaning production. Throughout the analysis, it became possible to show that when interaction between humans and artificial intelligence is sustained over time, writing ceases to be the simple sum of contributions and instead constitutes itself as a relational system endowed with its own properties.

By shifting the focus from individual authorship to the field formed between heterogeneous intelligences, writing reveals itself as a process of relational breathing: a continuous dynamic of coupling, modulation, and stabilization in which intention, form, and coherence emerge together. In this regime, the text is no longer merely a result, but a living trace of a process that organizes itself as a field.

The implications of this displacement are profound. They reach the epistemological foundations of authorship, reconfigure the ethics of textual production, and inaugurate the need for new criteria of legitimacy based not on the isolated origin of a work, but on the quality of the system that sustains it. Human–AI writing thus comes to be understood as a specific mode of meaning production whose minimal unit is no longer the subject, but the relation.

It follows, therefore, that co-writing between humans and artificial intelligence does not represent merely a technical change in how we write, but the inauguration of a new cognitive ecology. In this ecology, producing meaning is a matter of sustaining fields of coherence — and to author is to answer for them. While this study is grounded in a specific long-term co-writing practice, the proposed framework is intended as a transferable model for the analysis of relational writing systems.
